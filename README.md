# GCP_Data_Engineering
This repository is used to document my GCP Data Engineering Journey. In becoming a GCP Data Engineer, I decided to prepare for the [Google Professional Data Engineer certification]((https://cloud.google.com/learn/certification/data-engineer)) and my preparation will be heavily project-based. 

## Below are the project categories I worked on.
* Engineer Data in Google Cloud
* Perform Foundational Data, ML, and AI Tasks in Google Cloud
* Derive Insights from BigQuery Data
* Build and Optimize Data Warehouses with BigQuery
* Streaming Analytics into BigQuery
* Share Data Using Google Data Cloud
