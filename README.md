# GCP_Data_Engineering
This repositoring is used to document my GCP Data Engineering Journey. In becoming a GCP Data Engineer, I decided to prepare for the Google Professional Data Engineer certification. And my preparation will be heavily project-based. 

## Below are the projects categories I worked on.
* Engineer Data in Google Cloud
* Perform Foundational Data, ML, and AI Tasks in Google Cloud
* Insights from Data with BigQuery
* Build and Optimize Data Warehouses with BigQuery
* Streaming Analytics into BigQuery
* Share Data Using Google Data Cloud
